# massbypass
is a powerful tool for automating the discovery of access control bypasses by exploiting RFC 3986 edge cases and implementation flaws. It targets endpoints that return 401, 403, 404, or authentication redirects, and attempts to bypass these restrictions using a comprehensive suite of URL manipulation techniques.
